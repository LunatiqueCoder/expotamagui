   <br>

  [Development build][1] (recommended)

   >  Run `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to create the development builds. After that, when you can also use `i` or `a` to run your app from the Metro Bundler terminal, without creating the development builds again. Rerunning the app is usually necessary when something changes on the native side.
